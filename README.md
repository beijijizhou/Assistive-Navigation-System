# Assisative Navigation System
This novel assistive navigation system is designed specifically for visually impaired users, addressing the shortcomings of existing map navigation systems which often lack detailed features crucial for this demographic. The proposed system integrates traditional navigation with PostGIS to generate customized routes that consider the number of turns, landmarks, and obstacles.
